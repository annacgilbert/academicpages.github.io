PicturedRocks is a tool for the analysis of single cell RNA-seq data. Currently, we implement two marker selection approaches: a 1-bit compressed sensing based sparse SVM algorithm and a mutual information-based Max Relevance min Redundancy algorithm. Marker selection is defined simply as feature selection (in machine learning).

We emphasize that this software and its attendant __rigorous__ analysis is very much a work in progress. We will be updating it as we determine better its empirical performance. Please contact us with your feedback and performance results!
