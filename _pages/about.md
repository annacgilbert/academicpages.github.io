I received an S.B. degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Princeton University, both in Mathematics. In 1997, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University and AT&T Labs-Research. From 1998 to 2004, I was a member of technical staff at AT&T Labs-Research in Florham Park, NJ. Since then, I have been with the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, where I am now the Herman H. Goldstine Collegiate Professor. I also have a joint appointment in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have received several awards, including a Sloan Research Fellowship (2006), an NSF CAREER award (2006), the National Academy of Sciences Award for Initiatives in Research (2008), the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Douglas Engelbart Best Paper award (2008), the EURASIP Signal Processing Best Paper award (2010), and the SIAM Ralph E. Kleinman Prize (2013).
