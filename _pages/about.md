- Jun Z. Li (Departments of Human Genetics and Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics) and I are the co-directors of the [Michigan Center for Single-Cell Genomic Data Analytics](http://midas.umich.edu/research/health/single-cell/). Our research team will connect mathematicians and data scientists with biological researchers to develop, evaluate, and implement a variety of cutting-edge methodologies in sparse data analysis.
- I will be on sabbatical during the academic year 2017--2018 and have received a Simons Fellowship in Mathematics for 2017.
