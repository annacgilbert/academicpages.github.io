News

-New paper! Anna C. Gilbert, Yi Zhang, Kibok Lee, Yuting Zhang, Honglak Lee, "Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks," to appear in IJCAI 2017.
-I gave ten lectures on Sparse Analysis at the CBMS Conference on Sparse Approximation and Signal Recovery Algorithms in Las Cruces, NM, May, 2017.
-Jun Z. Li (Departments of Human Genetics and Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics) and I are the co-directors of the Michigan Center for Single-Cell Genomic Data Analytics. Our research team will connect mathematicians and data scientists with biological researchers to develop, evaluate, and implement a variety of cutting-edge methodologies in sparse data analysis.
-I will be on sabbatical during the academic year 2017--2018 and have received a Simons Fellowship in Mathematics for 2017.

------
I received an S.B. degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Princeton University, both in Mathematics. In 1997, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University and AT&T Labs-Research. From 1998 to 2004, I was a member of technical staff at AT&T Labs-Research in Florham Park, NJ. Since then, I have been with the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, where I am now the Herman H. Goldstine Collegiate Professor. I also have a joint appointment in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have received several awards, including a Sloan Research Fellowship (2006), an NSF CAREER award (2006), the National Academy of Sciences Award for Initiatives in Research (2008), the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Douglas Engelbart Best Paper award (2008), the EURASIP Signal Processing Best Paper award (2010), and the SIAM Ralph E. Kleinman Prize (2013).

My research interests include analysis, probability, discrete mathematics, and algorithms. I am especially interested in randomized algorithms with applications to harmonic analysis, signal and image processing, and massive datasets.
