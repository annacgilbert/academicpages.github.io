-__Graduate student openings!__ Now accepting applications for original, independent, curious, and passionate graduate students in Mathematics (https://math.yale.edu/graduate-programs), Applied Mathematics (https://applied.math.yale.edu/graduate-program/admissions), and Statistics & Data Science (https://statistics.yale.edu/academics/phd-program).
- __New job!__ I am moving to Yale University where I am jointly appointed in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics & Data Science.
- __New paper!__ Rishi Sonthalia and Anna C. Gilbert, ["Tree! I am no Tree! I am a Low Dimensional Hyperbolic Embedding" ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03847), to appear in NeurIPS 2020.
- __New paper!__ Rishi Sonthalia and Anna C. Gilbert, ["Project and Forget: Solving Large-Scale Metric Constrained Problems" ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03853)(Arxiv version, in submission), 2020.
- __New paper!__ Chenglin Fan, Anna C. Gilbert, Benjamin Raichel, Rishi Sonthalia, and Gregory Van Buskirk ["Generalized Metric Repair on Graphs" ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08411)(Arxiv version, accepted to SWAT 2020), 2019-2020. (This paper is a merger of an earlier paper on graph metric repair with Rishi Sonthalia and a similar paper by Fan, Raichel, and Van Buskirk, also on graph metric repair. Our collaboration improved both of our papers.)
- __New paper!__ Anna Gilbert, Albert Gu, Christopher Re, Atri Rudra, Mary Wootters ["Sparse Recovery for Orthogonal Polynomial Transforms" ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08362)(Arxiv version, accepted to ICALP 2020), 2019-2020.
