- __New paper!__Anna C. Gilbert, Audra McMillan, ["Local Differential Privacy for Physical Sensor Data and Sparse Recovery"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05916.pdf), 2017.
- __New paper!__ Anna C. Gilbert, Yi Zhang, Kibok Lee, Yuting Zhang, Honglak Lee, ["Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08664), to appear in IJCAI 2017.
- I gave ten lectures on Sparse Analysis at the [CBMS Conference on Sparse Approximation and Signal Recovery Algorithms](https://www.math.nmsu.edu/~jlakey/cbms2017.html) in Las Cruces, NM, May, 2017.
- Jun Z. Li (Departments of Human Genetics and Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics) and I are the co-directors of the [Michigan Center for Single-Cell Genomic Data Analytics](http://midas.umich.edu/research/health/single-cell/). Our research team will connect mathematicians and data scientists with biological researchers to develop, evaluate, and implement a variety of cutting-edge methodologies in sparse data analysis.
- I will be on sabbatical during the academic year 2017--2018 and have received a Simons Fellowship in Mathematics for 2017.
